# Textual Sandbox

A sandbox repo where I will test small things, bugs, ideas, etc, against the
[latest public release](https://pypi.org/project/textual/#history) of
[Textual](https://textual.textualize.io/).

If you have landed here for some reason, while looking for information
about, or help with, Textual, please head over to the [main help
page](https://textual.textualize.io/help/) for details on all the help
resources available.

**PLEASE NOTE:** This is my own sandbox: still will move, still will break,
stuff will go away. Perhaps the whole repo will go away.

Ain't nowt to do wi't'Textual repo.
